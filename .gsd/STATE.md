## Current Position

- **Phase**: 10 (Completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary

Phase 10 executed successfully. 2 plans (Optimization Logic, Display Integration) completed and verified.

- Implemented `circuitToExpressions` to generate nested logic strings using restricted gate sets (e.g., NAND-only).
- Enhanced `optimizeCircuit` to automatically remove double negations and redundant buffers.
- Created `GateExpressionDisplay` for hierarchical, color-coded logic visualization.
- Integrated consistent color mapping between Netlist and logic expressions.

## Next Steps

1. Review the final product and prepare for v1.0 release.
2. Consider future milestones (v1.1: Circuit Visualization).
