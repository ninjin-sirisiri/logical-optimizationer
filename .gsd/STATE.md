## Last Session Summary

Phase 9 executed successfully. 3 plans (Polish, E2E, Finalization) completed and verified.
Application is polished, tested with Playwright, and documented for deployment.
Fixed `bun test` configuration to correctly exclude E2E tests, ensuring clean test runs.
Configured Cloudflare Pages deployment settings (wrangler.toml, package.json).

## Next Steps

1. Execute Phase 10: Optimize results display and gate transformation logic.
2. Ensure "Optimized Expression" respects gate constraints.
3. Implement double negation removal in circuit synthesis.
4. Maintain consistent color coding across transformations.
