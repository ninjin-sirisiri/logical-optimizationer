## Current Position

- **Phase**: 9 (Integration & Polish)
- **Task**: Fix UI visibility issues
- **Status**: Completed

## Last Session Summary

Fixed a UI visibility issue where the "Add Variable" buttons in `VariableManager` were difficult to see due to low contrast.

- Buttons now use a white background (dark gray in dark mode) with a distinct border and shadow to pop against the container.
- Icon stroke width increased to 3 for better readability.
- Button variation `outline` added to UI library.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 8 objectives: E2E Testing, Performance, etc.
