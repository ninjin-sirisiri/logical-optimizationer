# STATE.md

## Current Position

- **Phase**: 5
- **Task**: Planning complete
- **Status**: Ready for execution

## Last Session Summary

- Completed Phase 5 (Gate Conversion) discussion.
- Decisions documented in `DECISIONS.md`:
  - Defined `GateNode` and DAG-based circuit representation.
  - Adopted template-based recursive substitution for gate conversion.
  - Implemented peephole optimization for cleanup (e.g., double negation removal).
  - Clarified handling of common sub-expressions and fan-outs via DAG.

## Next Steps

1. `/plan 5` — Create execution plans for Phase 5 implementation.
2. Implement `GateNode` types and `Circuit` interface.
3. Implement core gate conversion logic and optimization passes.
